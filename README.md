The one and only place for all Pokemon beginners (and not only) to learn what to do to beat other Pokemons

## Main goal

Everyone would like to quickly check what's effective and what's not so effective when fighting specific Pokemons in the wild or against the trainer we hate the most (looking at you GooseMaster46).

I've been playing Pokemons for more than 15 years and even I forget what's effective against Starmie or Spiritomb. Who wants to remember that anyway?

## Usage

For this app to work it requires my [PokemonAPI](https://github.com/PepeKwapien/PokemonBasics) (I am currently trying to deploy it somewhere. I'll update this section once I figure it out)

Simply just type a name of a Pokemon you want to beat the Grimer out of and check things like type effectiveness, abilities and stats so you don't get surprised by things like Purugly's Speed (no seriously, check it, it's nuts)
