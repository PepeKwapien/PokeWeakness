The one and only place for all Pokemon beginners (and not only) to learn what to do to beat other Pokemons

## Main goal

Everyone would like to quickly check what's effective and what's not so effective when fighting specific Pokemons in the wild or against the trainer we hate the most (looking at you GooseMaster46).

I've been playing Pokemons for more than 15 years and even I forget what's effective against Starmie or Spiritomb. Who wants to remember that anyway?

## Usage
Curently entire system is deployed to [Cloud](https://victorious-field-08360b803.3.azurestaticapps.net/).

Have patience when launching it for the first time. I'm using free services and tiers to host everything for now. With the first request you might encounter my inactive database which likes to cosplay Snorlax. It will wake up after 1-2 minutes after first request so have patience Trainer!

For this app to work it requires my [PokemonAPI](https://github.com/PepeKwapien/PokemonBasics)

Simply just type a name of a Pokemon you want to beat the Grimer out of and check things like type effectiveness, abilities and stats so you don't get surprised by things like Purugly's Speed (no seriously, check it, it's nuts)
